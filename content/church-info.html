    <h2 id="history-title" class="section-title">Our History</h2>
    <div class="history-content">
      <p class="history-intro">
        Living Faith Christian Center was birthed from a divine vision in 1985 when Pastor John Adeyemi 
        and fifteen faithful believers gathered in a small living room in Surulere, Lagos. What began as 
        a humble prayer meeting has grown into a thriving congregation of over 2,000 members, touching 
        lives across Lagos State and beyond.
      </p>
      
      <div class="history-narrative">
        <h3 class="history-subtitle">The Early Years (1985-1990)</h3>
        <p class="history-text">
          In those early days, we met under a mango tree, with nothing but faith and a burning desire to 
          see God's kingdom established in our community. Despite facing numerous challenges, including 
          lack of a permanent meeting place and limited resources, the congregation remained steadfast. 
          God's faithfulness was evident as we witnessed miraculous healings, financial breakthroughs, 
          and transformed lives.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="history-subtitle">Growth and Expansion (1990-2000)</h3>
        <p class="history-text">
          By 1990, through the generous contributions of members and divine provision, we acquired our 
          first church building on Church Street. This 200-capacity auditorium became a beacon of hope 
          in the community. We launched our first outreach programs, including a feeding initiative for 
          street children and a scholarship program for underprivileged students. Our membership grew 
          from 15 to over 500 believers.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="history-subtitle">Multiplication and Impact (2000-2010)</h3>
        <p class="history-text">
          The new millennium brought unprecedented growth. We expanded to multiple services to accommodate 
          the growing congregation and established our first branch church in Ikeja. Our youth ministry 
          flourished, producing young leaders who are now serving in various capacities across Nigeria. 
          We also launched our media ministry, broadcasting services on local radio stations and reaching 
          thousands who couldn't attend physically.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="history-subtitle">Modern Era (2010-Present)</h3>
        <p class="history-text">
          In 2015, we celebrated our 30th anniversary by dedicating our new 2,500-capacity worship center, 
          complete with modern facilities including a children's church, counseling center, and media studio. 
          The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 accelerated our digital transformation, leading to the establishment 
          of our robust online ministry platform that now reaches believers across Nigeria and in the diaspora.
        </p>
        
        <p class="history-text">
          Today, Living Faith Christian Center stands as a testament to God's faithfulness. We have planted 
          five branch churches across Lagos State, established a Bible training institute, and continue to 
          impact our community through various social intervention programs. Our journey from fifteen believers 
          under a mango tree to a multi-campus church is a story of divine grace, faithful stewardship, and 
          unwavering commitment to the Great Commission.
